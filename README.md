Floating point conversion program

This is a command line program that allows the user to type in a decimal number and the program will convert it to a floating point value and tell the user what the values are for the Biased Exponent and Mantissa. Then it will represent the decimal value as a Hex number. The user also has the option to enter a hex number and the program will output the sign, denormalized or normalized decimal, and the regular decimal.
